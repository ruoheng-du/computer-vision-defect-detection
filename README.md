# Computer Vision: Defect Detection | Summer 2022
This is the repository for some of the summer research assistant work done at Shanghai Jiao Tong University during Summer 2022. The research project uses the YOLOv5 model for training and recognition. Some of the programming and tidying work I've done through Python and Google Colaboratory can be found in the preprocessing_work and YOLOv5 directories respectively. Due to special reasons, part of the training process (/YOLOv5/yolov5-master/runs/train/...) has not been uploaded for external display. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information.
